    "# Machine Learning Experiment \\#0\n",
    "\n",
    "First time messing around with neural networks. Attempting to use time series data as input, having the model predict the next value based on the previous N values. Fake data is constructed so that the probability distribution for the next value depends on the previous N values (or a subset of them) in an obvious way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficult to disentangle input variables that are highly correlated. Two examples of this:\n",
    "* Raw random walk data have strong correlation between adjacent values (since adjacent values are always within +/- 1). Use diff instead of the raw values to obtain independent inputs.\n",
    "* Model data used a probability depending entirely on the previous tick, i.e. if the previous tick was an up-tick, the current tick has an 80% probability of being an up-tick as well. Ideally the ML would identify this and give a weight of zero to all but the most recent tick. However, the second-last tick is extremely likely to be in the same direction as the last, so it is difficult for the model to tell the difference.\n",
    "Because of this, I was not able to train a model (not quickly anyway) to understand the exact rule and guess the exact probability, but its guess would still almost always lean towards the more likely outcome (up or down).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward used for training was based on the outcome +1 or -1 rather than the probability, so whenever the less likely outcome occured, the model would receive negative reinforcement. This amount of noise leads to slower convergence."
